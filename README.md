# Goods-Locator

A web service __to make the essentials available__ to the citizens by __linking the registered/unregistered organizations or individuals__, willing to contribute during the corona pandemic outbreak. Our web service provides a platform to these individuals. This web service __can even be used other than during the pandemic outbreak__, to provide services to everyone and a platform to small scale production houses and retailers to sell their products.

## Features

* The website provides an account to
  *  People who need services, where they could regularly update their requirements and get the respective locations. Also, a delivery option would be provided, selecting which they would be asked to update their requirements on the __Chatbot__ provided. 
  * Individuals/Organizations willing to volunteer, where they could update their availability status and also look for volunteers in other areas.
  * Retailers/Producers where they could update about their location, the product they deal in, and stock availability. 
* All the people above would be required to upload their __National ID__ in order to verify them and _prevent any kind of frauds_.
* A list of current volunteers would be provided on the website so that anyone could reach them for joining them or collecting any other information.
* We have assumed that some particular volunteers have been assigned to provide services to only some particular areas. So, people in those areas who need services would be attended by these volunteers only.
* This communication between the people and the volunteers would be done through a __Chatbot__ where
  * People would upload their requirements in the form of a file or text. 
  * The concerned volunteers would look after these.
  * Anyone could hold a personal chat with anyone or a group he/she wants.
